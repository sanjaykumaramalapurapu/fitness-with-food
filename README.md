Fitness with food web application
This is a simple and interactive Calorie Calculator & Fitness Tracker web application built using Python Flask. The main purpose of this project is to help users understand how many calories they consume through food and how many they can burn through different activities and exercises. It includes four key sections:

Calorie Intake Calculator:
This feature allows users to enter the quantity of food items like rice, roti, dal, etc., and calculates the number of calories gained. For example, if a user inputs 100 grams of rice, the app displays how many calories they would consume from that.

Games Section (Calorie Burn Estimator):
In this section, users can enter their weight and the number of minutes they play physical games like football, cricket, or basketball. The app then calculates how many calories they burn based on their inputs.

Exercise Tracker:
This section includes exercises such as running, skipping, jumping jacks, etc. Based on the userâ€™s weight and time spent, it estimates the calories burned during each exercise.

Health Tips:
A dedicated section that offers useful fitness and nutrition tips to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The app combines education and engagement to motivate users toward better health choices. It is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and deployed using Render connected to GitHub, making it accessible from anywhere.
